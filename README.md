Why does this help my work, You may ask. Well lets say you want to open a different file in Google Docs, You could moove you mouse over to file and than click and than click open. But, that takes 5ish seconds when you could just hit Ctrl+O, poof. 

If you have any questions about anything on the Github feel free to email me at 23wgillis@xbhs.net
